ABSTRACT

    In this research paper, the aim is to improve the performance of outdated models of computers through a program we created based on batch scripting called performance optimizer. In this program, it commands the machine through the command prompt.
    This study tested if the various modifications by the program improve app launching, boot time, and internet speed and responsiveness. After testing, the data gathered from three subjects that undergone three trials was used in the three-phased calculation that averaged the difference between before and after the computer was modified. 
   The results of the experiments varied and were ultimately dependent on each of the subject’s inherent performance. Subject 1 received the most adverse effects initially, but then it improved after becoming more accustomed to the modifications after a week except internet speed and responsiveness. On the other hand, Subject 2 had benefited the most from the optimizer as it significantly improved its overall performance. However, among all three subjects, Subject 3 was the fastest even before the optimizer was applied. It only received minor improvements, mostly because the laptop already had excellent performance. Hence, it cannot be further improved significantly.
   The study gathered information on the effects of an optimizer upon a varied selection of laptops, each possessing varying levels of performance. The optimizer is most effective when used on laptops, which have a low performance, improving them with different degrees of effectiveness. In terms of its capability of improving the laptop’s access to the internet, the optimizer was successful. Therefore, the recommendation drawn upon the results of the study is that the optimizer can be applied on outdated laptops to improve their functionality and avoid their obsoletion.

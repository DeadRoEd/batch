ABSTRACT

     In this research paper, the aim is to improve the performance of outdated models of computers through a program we created based on batch scripting called performance optimizer. In this program, it commands the computer through the command prompt.
     This study conducted experiments to test if the various modifications that are applied by the program improves app launching times, boot time, and internet speed and responsiveness. There were three subjects that had gone three trials. The data gathered from these trials were used in the three-phased calculation that averaged the difference between before and after the computer was patched, as well as the difference if the computer was tested after a week it was patched. 
     The results of the experiments varied, and were ultimately dependent on each of the subjectâ€™s inherent performance. Subject 1 received the most negative results initially but improved after becoming more accustomed to the modifications for a week except its internet speed. Subject 2 had the most beneficial results, the optimizer drastically improved its overall performance. Subject 3 was the most functional out of the three before the optimizer was applied. As a result, it only received minor improvements, but we attribute this mostly to the already excellent performance of the laptop. Simply put, it cannot be further improved upon in a significant manner.
     The study gathered information on the effects of an optimizer upon a varied selection of laptops, each possessing its own level of performance. The optimizer is most effective when used on laptops which have a low performance, improving them with different degrees of effectiveness. In terms of its capability of improving the laptops access to the internet, the optimizer was successful. Therefore, the recommendation drawn upon the results of the study is that the optimizer can be applied on outdated laptops to improve their functionality and avoid their obsoletion.
